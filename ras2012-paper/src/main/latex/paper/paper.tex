\title{RAS2012: Competition Entry}
\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This article describes an entry to the 2012 RAS Problem Solving Competition, concerning dispatching on multi-track territories. The entry is based on the Drools Planner, a Java-based solver. On a reasonably recent computer, the resulting algorithm is able to produce feasible results within a minute and has been fine-tuned to provide best results in under 3 minutes. Source code to the entry is open source and well documented.

\section{Introduction}

\section{Describing the solution}

\section{Implementation}

\section{Achieved results}

Running the algorithm described above 20 times over each data set, we have compiled a set of results, see Table \ref{table:results}. All these were reached within 3 minutes in a single-threaded run, using Intel i7 Q820 processor running Fedora 17 and 2 GB of heap space inside Java 7 runtime environment.

\begin{table}
\caption{Solution performance per data set.}
\begin{tabular}{c||c|c|c|c|c|c}
\hline \hline
    & Best    & Q1      & Q2      & Q3      & Worst   & Std. dev. \\ 
\hline
TOY & \$808   & \$960   & \$1210  & \$1210  & \$1210  & 164 \\ 
\hline 
1   & \$1435  & \$1695  & \$1930  & \$2856  & \$5612  & 1219 \\ 
\hline 
2   & \$8097  & \$10364 & \$14865 & \$16177 & \$22486 & 4088 \\ 
\hline 
3   & \$10617 & \$13247 & \$15367 & \$17307 & \$21384 & 2986 \\ 
\end{tabular} 
\label{table:results}
\end{table}

Please note that via the benchmarking functionality of Drools Planner (see above), users may be able to fine-tune the algorithm to be focused either on providing better solutions or on faster turnaround times.

For statistics of the resolved systems, see tables \ref{table:TOY-808.tex}, \ref{table:RDS1-1435.tex}, \ref{table:RDS2-8097.tex} and \ref{table:RDS3-10617.tex} respectively.

In this section, we show examples of visualizations that the solution is capable of providing. These visualizations have been rendered on the fly using the JUNG library\footnote{Java Universal Network/Graph framework, http://jung.sourceforge.net}.
