This folder contains the JavaCC definition of the parser for the application. 
(The file is called "parser.jj".) 

When compiling the project from Maven, the parser classes will be generated as 
part of the build. When using the project from Eclipse, to have a clean project 
build, please install the JavaCC plugin for Eclipse.
