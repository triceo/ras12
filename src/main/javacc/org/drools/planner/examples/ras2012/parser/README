This folder contains the JavaCC definition of the parser for the application. 
(The file is called "parser.jj".) 

It also contains the parser files that were auto-generated by the Eclipse plugin
for JavaCC - those are only necessary in order to have the project fully compile
inside Eclipse.

When compiling the project from Maven, the parser files will be generated as 
part of the build and the files in this folder will be ignored. Making any
modifications to these files will not help you in any way - whatever you want to
change in the parser, you must do so directly in the JavaCC parser definition.
